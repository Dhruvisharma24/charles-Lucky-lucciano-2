    <h2> <i>Criminal records</i> </h2>
    <hr>

</h4><br>

<h2> <i>"Their Cover"</i> </h2>
    <hr>
<h4> He started robbing, theft, and extortion at the age of ten in 1906. He was imprisoned for six months for selling heroin in 1916.
     As a result of his ability to avoid being arrested and win craps games.<br>  He oversaw the delivery of drugs, prostitution, and bootlegging by
      1925 when he rose to the rank of chief lieutenant in Masseria.Before the Allies invaded Italy in World War II, Luciano is said to have assisted the
       government in Sicily by establishing contacts and gathering intelligence. Additionally, he asserted that by virtue of his waterfront ties, he was
        able to stop enemy maritime sabotage within American waters. Following the commutation of his sentence in 1946, Luciano was sent to Italy. <br> 
<br> 
        <h2> <i>Wanted & known for</i> </h2>
        <hr>
    <h4> Lucky Luciano is renowned for his contributions to the formation of the Commission, his ascent 
        through the ranks of organised crime, his role in the demise of the old guard, and his creation of the 
        contemporary American Mafia. Lucky Luciano was well-known for his abilities to think strategically, be well-organized,
         and build partnerships with powerful people in the criminal underworld. Being a born organiser, he was instrumental in 
         the founding of the Commission and the national crime syndicate. In addition, Luciano had a reputation for competence in illegal
          endeavours like eluding capture and winning craps games, and he was skilled at avoiding arrest.
          <br>
          <br>
          A bunch of men stabbed and thrashed him after kidnapping him. A cop found Luciano, who had been left for dead on a Staten Island beach,
           and brought him to the hospital. Masseria, the head of organised crime, or the police may have been the one to organise the attack, however
            this was not confirmed. About this period, Masseria and rival ruler Salvatore Maranzano were embroiled in a territorial dispute. After many
             years of employment with Masseria, Luciano began to back Marazano. He was involved in the plans that led to Masseria's horrific demise in April of 1931.

          Bootlegging, drug distribution, forced prostitution, and other rackets were among Lucky Luciano's most well-known offences.
